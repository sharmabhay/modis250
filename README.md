# modis250

Creating a Machine Learning model using Random Forest and Neural Networks, then comparing the results and their efficiencies in R, Python Tensorflow.Keras, Python Scikit-Learn (?) and Google AutoML.
Mapping Global Vegetation (Leaf Area Index & Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation) at 250m Resolution with MODIS Satellite Imagery using Transfer Learning of the MODIS15 Algorithm in Google Earth Engine. Improvements made by mapping Global Vegetation (Leaf Area Index) at 10m Resolution with Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery.
